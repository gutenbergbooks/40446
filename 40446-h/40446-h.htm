<hr class="tiny" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>Having read papers on Fly-fishing before the
Gresham and Islington Angling Societies,
and contributed occasional articles to the fishing
periodicals, I have been persuaded by some of the
members of those societies to publish my ideas on
the subject, and I now submit them to the public,
premising that the following treatise is neither
historic nor scientific, but simply an endeavour to
communicate what nearly fifty years of practice and
careful observation have taught me to consider as
correct principles in a concise and practical form.
Trusting that it will be received as such, and will be of
some assistance to young anglers in cultivating that,
which, we are assured by the highest authority on
angling, is "an art worth learning."</p>

<p>In preparing this short treatise I have assumed,
what is generally admitted by fishermen, that catching
trout with an artificial fly is the highest branch of
the piscatorial art; for, although some bottom-fishers
and spinners claim that as much skill is required in
their branch as is in fly-fishing, yet I think the
palm must be yielded to the fly-fisher. It differs in
many respect from all other kinds. The greatest care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
must be taken not to scare the fish, either by the sight
of the angler or his shadow, or by awkwardness in
managing the rod, line, and flies. You have only to
watch a fly-fisher and a bottom-fisher a short time
to decide where the greatest skill is required and
attained.</p>

<p>I recollect, when a very little boy, having a book,
in which there was a coloured print of a trout, and
underneath were these lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Angler, mind well what you're about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you would catch the cunning trout,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and I suppose I must have profited by the advice,
for in an old diary, kept by me in 1839, there is a
record of my having caught four trout weighing
7<span class="num">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">4</span>lbs. when I was thirteen years of age. But those
were not caught with a fly.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Francis Francis, than whom there is
no higher authority, says in one of his books, "There
is far greater skill, caution, patience, and cunning
required to delude a brook trout than is thought of
in landing the noblest twenty-pound salmon that
ever sailed up Tweed or Tay." And in further proof
of this I will give an extract from that excellent little
book, "Stewart's Practical Angler." The author says:
"Everything combines to render fly-fishing the
most attractive of all branches of the angler's art.
The attempt to capture trout, which are seen to
rise at natural flies, is in itself an excitement which
no other method possesses. Then the smallness of
the hook and the fineness of the tackle necessary for
success increases the danger of escape, and consequently
the excitement and the pleasure of the
capture; and, for our own part, we would rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
hook, play, and capture a trout of a pound weight
with fly, than one of a pound and a half with minnow
or worm, where, the hooks being larger, there
is less chance of their losing their hold, and, the
gut being stronger, there is less risk of its breaking.
Artificial fly-fishing is also the cleanest and most
gentlemanly of all the methods of capturing trout.
The angler who practises it is saved the trouble of
working with worms, of catching, keeping alive, or
salting minnows, or searching the river's bank for
the natural insect. Armed with a light single-handed
rod and a few flies, he may wander from county
to county and kill trout wherever they are to be
found."</p>

<p>In addition to the pleasure and satisfaction experienced
in exerting the faculties necessary to
capture the most cunning and cautious of fish, what
can be more delightful in the sweet spring-time than
to take one's rod and stroll away into the green
meadows, by the side of the rippling brook, where
the eye is gratified by the trees and hedge-rows
which are putting forth their young leaves; where
the sense of smell is refreshed by innumerable wild
flowers and herbs, and where the ear is charmed by
the soft "coo" of the wood pigeon, the tinkling of a
distant sheep-bell, the cry of a partridge to its mate,
or the occasional splash of a trout in the stream,
which sounds alone disturb the silence? Well may
Walton exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I was for that time lifted above earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed of joys not promised in my birth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An all-wise Creator gave man dominion "over the
fish of the sea, over the fowls of the air, and over every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
living thing that moveth upon the earth;" and a
very large proportion of the human race, either from
motives of necessity or recreation, exercise the
powers thus given them either in killing or subjugating
the lower branches of the animal creation.</p>

<p>Without wishing to detract from other sports, I
think Walton was quite right in claiming for angling
a decided preference. In the present day it is
followed by men of all classes, from the nobleman
who owns miles of salmon river to the East-end
mechanic or apprentice, who trudges off to the Lea
river on a Sunday morning with his eighteenpenny
roach-rod, and many of whom, but for this angling
opportunity, would have no relaxation from the dull,
mill-horse round of their daily lives, save some kind,
perhaps, far more demoralising; but who, by its
judicious indulgence, by breathing the pure air of
the country, and by being brought into contact with
beautiful river scenery and animal and vegetable life,
re-invigorate their bodies, exalt their minds, and
beget a state of quiet contentment, patience, and
perseverance exceedingly useful in these days of
high-pressure wear-and-tear. Sir Henry Wotton
says of angling, he found it "a cheerer of the spirits,
a tranquillizer of the mind, a calmer of unquiet
thoughts, a diverter of sadness." Ladies, too, ever
since the time of Cleopatra, have liked to "betray
tawny-finn'd fishes," and Dame Juliana Berners has
shown by her "Boke of St. Albans" that she had a
minute and practical knowledge of "fyshynge with
an angle" far beyond the previous writers on the
art; and with the present rage for out-of-door amusements
among the fair sex, fishing has its votaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
notwithstanding the attractions of croquet and lawn-tennis.</p>

<p>Having been a fly-fisher many years, I venture to
offer a few ideas on the subject, not with a view to
instruct my elder brethren in the art, but merely to
explain some principles that my experience has
proved to be correct, and thereby to save, perhaps,
some trouble and loss of time to young beginners. I
am fully aware that no amount of theory without
practice will ever make a fly-fisher, but I am also
aware that practice will become much easier, and be
far more likely to prove successful, if based on a
correct theory, than if left to itself.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>WET AND DRY FLY-FISHING.</h3>


<p>Various opinions prevail as to wet and dry fishing,
and I think in this matter, if we want to deceive trout,
we should follow Nature as closely as possible. On a
dry, quiet day the wings of the natural fly are dry,
and when it falls on the water it takes some time
before they become saturated, and until then it
floats on the surface. Imitate this by giving your
artificial fly two or three flicks backwards and
forwards before you finally throw it. You thus shake
the water out of it, and it floats. But on wet or
very windy days the natural fly soon becomes wet
with rain, or from the broken surface of the water,
and at such times let the artificial lure sink a few
inches beneath the surface, and if the trout are feeding,
fishing in this manner is most deadly. At night
I have generally found wet fly-fishing to answer best,
even when there has been no rain, and I attribute
this to the natural flies becoming damp with dew
and thereby sinking. For dry fly-fishing floating
flies are now much used. The great objection to
them appears to be the hardness of their bodies,
which is no sooner found by trout to be different to
the natural fly than they blow it out without giving
time to strike. I have found this particularly with
cork-bodied May-flies, and prefer the ordinary body
in consequence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. G. Holland, of Salisbury, makes a speciality
of floating flies on eyed hooks and cobweb gut,
which bear an excellent reputation; and my friend,
Mr. R. B. Lodge, has lately invented a floating fly
with an air-tight body, which floats well and does
not get water-logged. If he can make it of a soft
material, not liable to be punctured by the trout's
teeth, I think there will be no doubt of its being a
great improvement.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>TACKLE.</h3>


<p>An important point is to commence with proper
tackle, for it is of no use to attempt to catch trout
with a cart-rope tied to a hedge-stake. First, then,
with regard to the Rod. A good rod is the angler's
chief requisite, and extraordinary progress has been
made in the art of manufacturing rods within the
last few years.</p>

<p>There are so many excellent makers that it is only
necessary to visit one of them and select a rod suitable
to your height, strength, and fancy, and in this,
as in many other respects, fancy goes a long way.
For all ordinary purposes, a rod from ten to twelve
feet in length will be sufficient, and I have generally
used those made in four pieces, the lower three of
greenheart, or hickory, and the top of bamboo. It
should be tolerably stiff, for in windy weather it is
impossible with a light whippy-rod to throw against
or across the wind and attain any degree of accuracy.
It should be double-brazed, so that the joints may
not become fixed by the swelling of the wood when
wet, and the brass joints should be made slightly
tapering, and the whole, when put together, should
taper regularly from butt to point, and when held
horizontally should be stiff enough to lie almost
level. It should, of course, be fitted with small brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
rings for the line to run through, which, if placed at
proper distances, divide the strain equally, keep the
line snug, and prevent entanglements.</p>

<p>Another matter of apparently trifling importance,
but really very essential, is, that near the ends of each
length of the rod, and being parallel with it, should
be a small brass loop or hitcher, tied on with fine
binding wire. Before commencing to fish, pass a
piece of thread or twist round each two of these
loops, and tie the joints firmly together; this will
prevent them from slipping, which is often the cause
of losing a good fish or breaking the rod. After the
season is over, clean the rod with very fine emery
powder, then let it lie in a trough filled with oil for a
day or two, and after it has been out of the oil long
enough for the surface to get dry, give it a couple of
coats of clear carriage varnish, and put it away for
the winter.</p>

<p>Split-cane rods appear to be much on the increase,
but they are rather expensive. It may be, perhaps,
from having been accustomed for many years to
greenheart that I do not take readily to the light,
springing motion of cane. This lightness is somewhat
modified by the use of steel centres, but unless
they can be made much cheaper than at present,
which I think doubtful, the price will be a great
hindrance to their coming into general use.</p>

<p>There were some splendid rods in the last Sportsmen's
Exhibition, and the man must be very hard to
please who could not find one to his taste there.
Among them all, the best I could see for usefulness,
at a moderate price, was a little rod called the
"Hotspur," built by Messrs. Hardy, of Alnwick. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
is made of greenheart, in two lengths, and only ten
feet long, but wonderfully powerful as well as pliant,
and is fitted with a spiral joint fastening, which
renders the tying above recommended unnecessary.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE WINCH LINE AND GUT.</h3>


<p>Now, as to the reel. Notwithstanding that some of
the books on fishing call the multiplying reel an
abomination, I always prefer one; finding that when
you hook a fish it is very desirable to have the means
of winding in the slack line quickly should he come
towards you. I have used a two-inch brass multiplier
some years, and never, to my knowledge, lost a fish
by its inaction. The revolving plate is a great
improvement on the old windlass.</p>

<p>Messrs. Foster, of Ashbourne, are making an
improved winch with a male screw to fit into the
female thread at the butt of the rod, where the spear
is usually fixed. This is a great advantage, as the
liability to get the line entangled is not so great as
with a side winch, and it also enables the angler
to make more of the length of his rod by grasping it
lower down.</p>

<p>The best line I know of is the "Acmé," also made
by Messrs. Foster. It is constructed of plaited silk,
with a very fine strand of annealed copper wire
running through it. The wire gives a little weight
and stiffness to the line, so that it does not kink or
knot up so readily as one made of all silk, while it is
about half the size of the old-fashioned line made of
mixed silk and hair. With this line much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
accurate casting can be made than with one of all
silk; and the late David Foster, the inventor of it,
says that by using it he increased the length of his
throw from 29<span class="num">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span>yds. to 32<span class="num">1</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">2</span>yds. with a single-handed fly
rod. But this is extraordinary casting, such as few
can accomplish. At the Casting Tournament, held
at Hendon five years ago, I saw 30yds. 6in. thrown.
Anyone who can throw a fly 25yds., clean and
straight, and pitch it within a yard of the object
aimed at, may consider himself a pretty good hand.
Where one can do it, ninety-nine cannot.</p>

<p>The gut or casting line should be moderately stout
at the upper part, and tapered down to the point,
and if stained of a dull blue or green colour is less
likely to be seen than when quite white.</p>

<p>I always make up my own casts by picking out
suitable lengths of gut and tying them together by
a fisherman's knot, and if anything gives way I have
no one but myself to blame. In cutting off the ends
of the gut do not cut them quite close to the knot,
but leave just sufficient to take hold of with a pair of
tweezers. Flatten out the ends by pinching them;
you thus prevent the knot from drawing, and it need
not be clumsy. It is far more economical to use the
best gut that can be obtained than to whip off your
flies, or lose a fish, by having a cheaper article.</p>

<p>The whole&mdash;rod, running line and casting line,
wholly and separately&mdash;should taper from one end to
the other, and should be in thorough proportion to
each other, and nothing but experience will enable
one how to ascertain when this is so. If the rod is too
stiff for the line you cannot deliver the latter properly,
and if the line is too heavy for the rod you run the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
risk of breaking the rod's back; while, if the gut is
too heavy for the line, it will pitch all in a heap, and,
of course, scare the fish.</p>

<p>Flies are commonly made with a loop at the end
of the gut, to be passed through a corresponding
loop at the end of the casting line. A much neater
plan is to cut off the loops, or buy your flies without
them, and tie the two ends together as above
described.</p>

<p>Flies tied on eyed hooks are a great improvement
on the old style. They are more easily packed, not
having that awkward coil of gut attached to them,
which is always so difficult to manage in a book, and
which is almost certain to result in the loss of some
flies on a windy day. They can be readily attached
and detached when necessary, and are lighter and
float better, and there is not that friction of the gut
at the most important point, as with flies tied on gut.
I have frequently found when fishing that the fly I
particularly wished to use on clear water was tied
on stout gut for rough water, and was larger than my
gut cast above it. This is wrong in principle, but
with eyed hooks gut to suit the water could easily be
tied on.</p>

<p>Never go out without a landing-net. The most
convenient is that with a telescopic handle and folding
ring. Near the upper end of the outside part of the
handle should be a brass spring hook, to slip over
the strap which crosses your chest towards the left
side. When you hook a fish, you can, without
moving the right hand from the rod, lift the landing-net
off with the left hand and throw out the handle
ready for use. A pair of waterproof wading-boots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
or stockings, a good pocket-knife, a piece of india-rubber,
with which to straighten the gut, a wicker
creel, and something to eat, drink, and smoke, and
you are equipped for a day's sport, with the exception
of flies, of which I shall next treat.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>FLIES.</h3>


<p>There is no subject on which anglers differ so much
as to what assortment of flies is necessary. Some
will carry as many as a hundred sorts in their book,
while a few, following Mr. Cholmondely Pennell, are
content with three nondescripts of quite an
unnatural appearance, and pretend they can catch as
many fish as the man who goes prepared with a
larger quantity. Walton names <em>nine</em>, beside caterpillars;
and Cotton mentions <em>sixty-nine</em>; while
Ronald, in his splendid work, describes very many
more to choose from. David Foster speaks of <em>thirty-one</em>.
My experience has taught me that about <em>twenty</em>
are necessary and sufficient for all ordinary purposes.
In calm weather and smooth water one fly at a time
is enough; but in rain, wind, or broken water, two,
three, or even four flies may be used with advantage,
as you give the fish a variety to choose from, and
can thereby find out which kind they are taking, and
adapt your cast to their taste.</p>

<p>The fly nearest the rod is called the "first drop,"
the next the "second drop," and so on, and the
farthest from the rod the "stretcher." The last drop
should be about 20in. from the stretcher, and the
other drops 12in. or 14in. apart. When it is thought
desirable to use more than one fly, bend the loop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
your drop fly round one of the knots in the casting-line,
and pass the drop through the loop thus bent
and draw it tight. The drop fly will thus stand at
right angles with the casting-line, and should be
about 3in. from it, and the trout will not be likely to
come in contact with the line when seizing the fly.</p>

<p>It does not very often happen that you hook two
trout at a time, and after you have hooked them,
the difficulty is to get them both into the landing-net,
as they dart about in divers directions; but I
succeeded in hooking and landing two at a time on
three occasions in the summer of 1881. In such
cases get the fish on the stretcher into the net first.
Two at a time necessitates good tackle and very
careful handling. When one can accomplish this
difficult feat, with two trout of a pound weight each,
he may consider himself a fly-fisher.</p>

<p>Artificial flies should represent, in size, shape, and
colour, as nearly as possible the natural flies which
frequent the water you are fishing.</p>

<p>On examining the following selection it will be found
that the natural flies are chiefly represented by three
colours&mdash;green, yellow, and brown; and, although
Mr. Pennell was so far right, the general appearance
of natural flies must also be imitated, if you would
achieve success. I do not hold it necessary to follow
minutely every colour, or the exact shape of the
natural fly, because nine out of every ten fish caught
seize the fly immediately it alights on the water, and
sometimes even before it touches; therefore they
cannot have time to study very particularly every
detail of the lure thus suddenly presented to them,
but, seeing something apparently resembling what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
they are feeding on, dash at it instantaneously, and
find out the mistake when it is too late. What is of
far greater importance than the exact representation
of the natural fly is, that when the artificial falls on
the water there should be nothing else occurring at
the same time to scare the fish. The motion of the
arm, the flash of the rod, the bungling of the casting-line,
or pitching the fly on the water in an unnatural
manner, all tend to make trout rise short, or not rise
at all.</p>

<p>In determining what colours to use it is desirable
to look at both natural and artificial specimens
through water from underneath, as they then appear
quite different to what they do when viewed out of
water. The late John Hammond, of Winchester,
designer of the Hammond's Adopted and Wickham's
Fancy, once showed me this through a clear-bottomed
decanter.</p>

<p>The following list of flies will be found in the
greater part of the United Kingdom, although they
may be called by different names in different
localities, the chief variation being in size rather
than colour or shape; and it is always desirable to
use artificial flies of the size of the natural ones
which are to be found in the locality you are
fishing:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Red Spinner</em>, <em>March Brown</em>, <em>Blue Dun</em>, <em>Alder Fly</em>,
<em>Hofland's Fancy</em>, <em>Stone Fly</em>, <em>Grannum</em>, <em>Wickham's
Fancy</em>, <em>Oak Fly</em>, <em>Sedge</em>, <em>Green Drake</em>, <em>Grey Drake</em>,
<em>Coachman</em>, <em>Black Palmer</em>, <em>Red Palmer</em>, <em>Coch-y-bonddhu</em>,
<em>Red Ant</em>, <em>July Dun</em>, <em>Black Gnat</em>, <em>White Moth</em>.</p>

<p>I am convinced that, with the above assortment of
flies, there are not many days in the season but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
one or other of them will do execution, and there is
seldom a day that trout do not rise at some time or
other in it, unless the water be too thick for them to
see the fly. As I am writing for the average fly-fisher,
who need not waste the time or take the
trouble to make his own flies, I will not attempt to
describe the manner of making them, believing that
it is much better to visit a good tackle shop and
get what is required; yet I think it desirable to show
of what materials they should be composed, in order
that he may know what are the most killing sorts,
and how to distinguish them in ordering.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">February and March.</span></p>

<p>1. <em>The Red Spinner.</em>&mdash;Body, brown silk, ribbed
with fine gold twist; tail, two fibres of a red cock's
hackle; wings, of some transparent brown feather.</p>

<p>2. <em>March Brown, or Brown Drake.</em>&mdash;This, like the
other drakes, is a great favourite with trout in its
season, which is during March and April, and it may
also be used in the autumn. Body, orange-coloured
silk or deep straw colour, on which wind fur from a
hare's poll; legs, a honey-dun hackle; wings, to
stand erect, of the top of the light or inner fibres of
the feather of the hen pheasant's wing; tail, two
fibres of the same feather. Rib with gold twist for
your tail fly, and let the droppers be without any
twist.</p>

<p>The above is "Ephemera's" way of making it,
but Mr. Ronalds says: "Body, fur of the hare's face
ribbed over with olive silk and tied with brown silk;
tail, two strands of a partridge's feather; wings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
feather of the pheasant's wing; legs, a feather from
the back of a partridge."</p>

<p>3. <em>Blue Dun.</em>&mdash;Body, of the hare's ear, dark and
yellow part mixed with a little yellow mohair, the
whole to be spun on yellow silk; wings, from a
feather of the starling's wing stained in onion dye;
tail, two whiskers of a rabbit; legs, to be picked out
of the dubbing at the thick part near the wings.</p>

<p>4. <em>Alder Fly.</em>&mdash;Body, dark claret-coloured fur;
upper wings, red fibre of the landrail's wing, or red
tail feather of the partridge; lower wings, of the
starling's wing feather; legs, dark red hackle; horns
and tail, of fibres the colour of the legs, the horns to
be shorter than the body of the fly, but the tail a
little longer.</p>

<p>5. <em>Hofland's Fancy.</em>&mdash;Body, reddish dark brown
silk; wings, woodcock's wing; legs, red hackle;
tail, two strands of a red hackle.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">April.</span></p>

<p>6. <em>Stone Fly.</em>&mdash;Body, fur from hare's ear mixed
with yellow worsted and spun on yellow silk; tail, two
strands of partridge feather; wings, pheasant's quill
feather from wings; legs, greenish brown hackle.</p>

<p>7. <em>Grannum, or Green-Tail.</em>&mdash;"Ephemera" says:
"The grannum is a four-winged fly, and as it swims
down the water its wings lie flat on the back. It
has a small bunch of eggs of a green colour at the
tail end of the body, which gives it the name of the
green-tail fly. As soon as it alights on the water it
drops its eggs." It is dressed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Body, fur of hare's face left rough and spun on
brown silk. A little green floss silk may be worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in at the tail, to represent the bunch of eggs there.
Wings, feather from that of the partridge, and made
very full; legs, a pale ginger hen's hackle. Made
buzz with a feather from the back of a partridge's
neck, wound upon the above body.</p>

<p>8. <em>Wickham's Fancy.</em>&mdash;Wings, light starling; body,
flat gold ribbed with fine gold wire; hackle and
whisk, bright red gamecock. This is one of the best
general flies, and is a standing favourite in the south
of England; and I have it on the authority of the late
John Hammond that he made it under the direction
of Dr. Wickham, of Winchester&mdash;hence its name.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">May and June.</span></p>

<p>9. <em>Oak Fly, or Down-Looker.</em>&mdash;It is generally found
on the trunks of oak trees by the river-side, with its
head pointing downwards, and is a very useful fly.</p>

<p>"Ephemera" recommends it to be dressed as
follows: "Body, yellow mohair, ribbed regularly with
dark brown silk; legs, a honey dun hackle wound
thrice under the wings, which are to lie flat and
short, and to be made of the wing feather of a
young partridge or hen pheasant. To be tipped
with pale gold twist."</p>

<p>10. <em>Sedge.</em>&mdash;Wings, wing of landrail; body, white
floss silk ribbed with silver wire; hackle, ginger
cock's hackle down the body.</p>

<p>11. <em>The May-fly, or Green Drake</em>, is not only a very
beautiful fly, but one of the most captivating that is
used, and, as I have stated elsewhere, it requires
special manipulation. On a windy dull day, in the
middle of the May-fly season, when there are not many
natural flies out, it will very soon fill the basket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
particularly if the water is turbulent. "Ephemera"
says: "This famous fly is the opprobrium of fly-makers.
Try how they will they cannot, in my
opinion, imitate it well. The wings are their greatest
foil. In making the body they succeed tolerably well.
Still, the best imitation is defective, and, except upon
rare occasions, the artificial May-fly is not a deadly
bait." My experience has been the very contrary of
this. Whether it is from the fly-tiers having succeeded
in imitating the natural fly since "Ephemera"
wrote, or not, I do not know, but I have before me
two specimens tied by Mrs. Ogden that I make no
doubt would bring me ten or a dozen brace of trout on
a good day in the season. May-flies are often made
with cork bodies, but I am not partial to them, for
the same objection which applies generally to floating
flies, viz.: that trout find they have something hard
and unnatural in their mouths, and immediately
reject it. On a dry bright day use it as a dry fly,
but on a very wet or windy day fish with it a few
inches under the surface, and, as Walton says, you
will have "store of trouts." On one occasion last
season I caught ten brace of trout with one May-fly
obtained of Messrs. Alfred and Son, and have it by
me now, but there is not a vestige of wing left, all
having been bitten off. Mr. Ronalds recommends it
to be dressed as follows: "Body, the middle part of
a pale straw-coloured floss silk, ribbed with silver
twist; extremities (head and tail), brown peacock's
harl, tied with light brown silk thread; tail, three
rabbit's whiskers; wings and legs, made buzz with
a mottled feather of the mallard, stained olive."
Instead of the bodies being made of straw-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
silk they are now frequently made of strips of wheat
straw.</p>

<p>12. <em>Grey Drake.</em>&mdash;This is said to be a metamorphosis
of the green drake, or female changing to a male.
Dress it thus: Body, the middle part of white floss
silk, ribbed over neatly with silver twist; extremities,
brown peacock's harl; wings and legs made buzz
with a mottled feather of the mallard, stained a faint
purple; legs, three rabbit's whiskers.</p>

<p>13. <em>The Coachman.</em>&mdash;Body, peacock's harl, full and
short; wings, fibres of any small white feather; legs,
a turn or two of a red hackle. Mr. Blaine remarks:
"Throughout the summer months, as an early
evening fly, and until twilight, it proves most valuable
in the midland counties, and the bordering ones
within eighty miles of London. On the Colne, and
throughout its course, in the Hampshire, Dorsetshire,
and Devonshire waters, where we have been
for many years in the habit of using it, in our opinion
there is no fly to at all equal it."</p>

<p>14. <em>Black Palmer.</em>&mdash;Body, black ostrich harl, ribbed
with gold twist, black cock's hackle wound over the
whole.</p>

<p>15. <em>Red Palmer.</em>&mdash;Body, dark red-coloured mohair,
with a richly-tinted red fur intermixed, to be ribbed
with gold or silver twist; legs, a blood-red cock's
hackle. Or, body, a peacock harl with a red cock's
hackle wrapped over it, and tied with dark brown
silk thread.</p>

<p>I have used the Red Palmer in all weathers and
seasons for nearly fifty years, and believe it to be the
best general fly there is, although, strictly speaking,
not a fly, but an imitation of the caterpillar, or larva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
of the tiger moth. Having had such success with it
I have adopted its name as my <em>nom de plume</em>, and as
the title of this little book.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">July.</span></p>

<p>16. <em>Coch-y-bonddhu.</em>&mdash;Body, black ostrich harl,
twisted with peacock's harl, and made with red silk
thread; the wings and legs made buzz with a dark
furnace hackle.</p>

<p>17. <em>Red Ant.</em>&mdash;Body, copper coloured peacock's
harl, full near the wings and tail; wings, a lark's
wing feather; legs, red cock's hackle.</p>

<p>18. <em>July Dun.</em>&mdash;Body, mole's fur and pale yellow
mohair mixed, and spun on yellow silk; wings, dark
part of a feather from the starling's wing, stained
dark in strong onion dye; legs, dark dun hackle; tail,
the two flies of the hackle.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">August.</span></p>

<p>19. <em>Black Gnat.</em>&mdash;Body, one of the smallest feathers
of the green plover's top-knot, or of a black harl, to
be dressed short; wings, the darkest fibres of an old
starling's wing feather.</p>

<p>20. <em>White Moth.</em>&mdash;Wings, white pigeon's feather;
body, white crewel; legs, white hen's hackle.</p>

<p>Although I have classified these flies under the
different months, it does not follow by any means
that they will kill only in the months named; on
the contrary, some of them may be used month after
month, particularly the hackle flies, which may be
used almost through the season.</p>

<p>I exhibited samples of the above kinds in my
lecture to the Gresham and Islington Angling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Societies, showing the relative sizes and colours.
These samples were selected from the stock of
Messrs. Alfred and Son, of Moorgate Street, where
I generally obtain what I require, and find their flies
are to be depended on. As with gut, so with flies,
it is false economy to buy the cheapest. It requires
a deal of patience at times before you can hook a
fish; and, after you have been so fortunate, it is
terribly annoying to find the gut draw, and leave
the fly in its mouth. To guard against this, <em>burn all
your old flies at the end of the season</em>, except one or two
of a sort for patterns, and this is another reason why
you should not have a heavy stock; and take care, in
buying your new stock at the spring of the year, that
you get new, and not those of the previous year.</p>

<p>In tying gut to the hook, a little varnish generally
touches the gut, and at this most critical point the
varnish hardens the gut and causes it to snap. This,
of course, does not occur with eyed hooks, but even
with them it is better to have new flies than old, as
the colours are fresher and the tying more secure.</p>

<p>Messrs. Ogden and Scotford, the well-known firm
of Cheltenham, have lately sent me a few samples of
their flies, tied by Mrs. Ogden, who has long enjoyed
a very high reputation for her tying. They
are beautifully made, and I have no doubt will
prove good killers; but, as the season is now over,
have had no opportunity of trying them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>UP OR DOWN STREAM.</h3>


<p>So much for the tackle to be used in fly-fishing, and,
being thus provided, in what way should the tyro go
to work? The first point to be considered is, Should
he fish up stream or down? Old Father Izaak
says, "fish down stream," but he was not much of
a fly-fisher, and I cannot help thinking that if he
had lived in the present day he would have seen fit
to alter his opinion in this respect. Fish, like
human beings, have advanced in education since
that time, and, if you want to catch a trout, get
behind him. I caught a large trout about eight
years ago in clear smooth water, where I did not
much expect to catch one, and on examining him I
found that he had only one eye, and I had got on
the blind side and pitched over him. The advantages
of fishing up stream appear to me so great
that I can hardly believe any good fly-fisher can
hold a contrary opinion; but, lest I should seem
prejudiced, I will give some reasons for my faith.
The trout always lies with its head up stream,
waiting for the food to come down, and if you
approach it from the rear you are not so likely to be
seen as when approaching it face to face. Again,
the natural fly floats down stream, and by throwing
up and letting the artificial float down you imitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the motion of the natural fly, taking care to raise
the point of the rod as the fly approaches you, so as
not to have any slack line out, for if you have, you
cannot strike properly. Another reason is, that if
while fishing <em>up</em> a trout rises, when you strike you
will in all probability hook it in the side of the
mouth as it turns; but when fishing <em>down</em>, if you
strike, the motion tends to draw the fly out of
the fish's mouth, and he does not lose much
time in getting rid of it if found not to his taste,
and then</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The trout within yon wimplin burn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Glides swift, a silver dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, safe beneath the shady thorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Defies the angler's art."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another important matter to consider is the direction
of the wind. Always, if you can, fish with the
wind behind you, or, at all events, so that you can
throw across it; but, if you must make a choice of
evils, choose the lesser, and fish <em>up</em> stream and
<em>against</em> the wind, rather than <em>down</em> stream and <em>with</em>
the wind. In considering which side of the river to
fish, do not, if you can help it, fish from that side
whence the sun would cast your shadow on the
water, as nothing is more alarming to trout. It is
impossible, in a short treatise like the present, to
give such instruction in throwing the fly as will
make the tyro an adept. It is desirable to practise
throwing with both the right and left sweep, as by
changing from one to the other you avoid getting
into the bad habit of twisting the rod, which would
assuredly warp and spoil it; and by practising short
throws with the left hand you will be able to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the right arm a few minutes' rest occasionally, a
great relief in a long day's fishing.</p>

<p>My advice is, to commence with a short line, and
when you find that you can deliver the line so as to
be prepared to hook a fish as soon as the fly touches
the water, gradually increase the length, taking care
never to attempt to throw more than you can send
out clean and straight, without disturbing the water.
But more can be learnt in this respect by an hour's
practice with an old hand, than by any amount of
theory. The great points are to keep well out of
sight, and to imitate the descent of the natural fly on
the water, which in the case of the smaller flies is as
soft and gentle as a piece of thistle-down; but with
the larger ones, such as the drakes and moths, whose
bodies are heavy in proportion to the size of their
wings, compared with other flies, let them fall with
a slight spat on the water, causing a ring to take
place on the surface, and letting the fish know it is
there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>STRIKING AND PLAYING.</h3>


<p>Considerable discussion has taken place in the
angling papers from time to time as to the proper
time for striking a fish; and three or four years
since some extraordinary calculations were made
with regard to the period that should elapse before
striking, and for the motion from the arm to reach
the hook. My opinion, as expressed in the "Angler's
Journal" at that time, and lately repeated in "Fishing,"
is as follows: "As soon as you become aware, either
by sight, sound, or feeling, that a fish has risen, put
the hook in him." But you must be careful not to
strike too hard, or you will either tear the hook out,
or snap the gut, and thus lose the fish. It should
only be a slight twitch, given from the wrist, as quick
as thought, just enough to drive the hook in beyond
the barb, but not enough to tear the flesh out. I
have often amused myself by feeding trout, and have
noticed that, after they have taken several pieces,
say of bread or paste, if I threw in something like it
in appearance, such, for instance, as a small white
stone, they would seize it, and, finding the substance
different, instantly blow it out again. It is reasonable
to assume that they would do the same with an
artificial fly, particularly those having cork bodies;
therefore you cannot strike too quickly. But, as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
is a branch of the subject on which great differences
of opinion exist, I will here quote some eminent
angling authorities in support of my views.</p>

<p><em>Francis Francis</em> says: "If a fish rises, a slight
upward turn of the wrist will be sufficient to fix the
hook. As for giving any direct rules when to strike,
they would be of little avail, as sometimes fish rise
quickly, sometimes with more circumspection, and
sometimes altogether falsely." Next, <em>Cummins</em>:
"When a trout takes your fly do not strike too hard;
more fish are lost by anglers striking when using
small flies than are secured by such means. The
line tightened is sufficient in most cases, particularly
in fishing streams." In "Fishing" of March 31st last
I say: "I agree that in rapid stream fishing there is
no necessity for striking." <em>Ephemera</em> also advises
that, "The moment you see, and then feel, a rise,
strike gently from the wrist." <em>Blaine</em> also writes to
the same effect. <em>Stewart</em>, in the "Practical Angler," has
the following passage: "A difference of opinion exists
as to whether trout should be struck on rising; but,
in common with the majority of anglers, we advocate
immediate striking. When a trout takes a fly it
shuts its mouth, and if the angler strikes then he is
almost sure to bring the hook into contact with the
closed jaws. We have frequently watched the
motions of trout on taking a fly, and when left to do
with it as they chose, they very quickly expelled it
from their mouths with considerable force; and we
think that, if the angler strikes, even when the trout's
mouth is open, he will have a much better chance
than by leaving it to hook itself. A trout on seizing
an artificial fly is almost instantaneously aware that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it is a counterfeit, and never attempts to swallow it;
very frequently letting it go before the angler has
time to strike, so that it is of the utmost importance
to strike immediately, and this is the reason why a
quick eye and a ready hand are considered the most
necessary qualifications for a fly-fisher." <em>Foster</em>, in
the "Scientific Angler" says: "The action requisite
is a short quick wrist-motion, commenced sharply
but ended almost instantly and abruptly, like
a quick movement of the hand in bringing a foil
in fencing from <em>tierce</em> to <em>carte</em>." It is impossible
to strike too quick, but it is quite possible to
strike too hard.</p>

<p>All the above opinions are based on the supposition
that a fish <em>has risen</em>. It is not very often that a trout
is seen in the act of rising, but should it be, of course
sufficient time must be given for it to reach the fly,
then strike at once. When you find that you have
hooked your fish, be prepared for its rush, and then
comes the time when all your patience, experience,
and lightness of hand, are called into requisition.
Let the fish have its head a little at first, taking care
to steer it clear of weeds, bushes, and sunken obstacles
in the water, and then give it a slight pressure from
the rod, in addition to the friction of the line which
it is dragging through the water; and if you can get
it down stream, so as not to disturb the fish above,
so much the better. When you have got it down
stream, and under command, do not be in too great
a hurry to land it, for sometimes when you think it is
spent it will make a sudden dart, and you lose it.
Give it plenty of time to tire itself out, then put the
landing net quietly into the water, slip it under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
fish, and lift it out. Then put the thumb of your
right hand into its mouth, with the fingers at the
back of its head, and press the upper jaw back
until its spine is broken. This is far better than
letting the fish flop about and discolour itself in the
creel.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>WHEN TO GO FISHING.</h3>


<p>Having explained the apparatus necessary for catching
trout, the next part of my subject appears to be
the time <em>when</em> to go fishing, and one important point
is the weather. Notwithstanding what some writers
have said about catching trout in an east wind, I do
not believe in it. With a wind from the South,
West, or South-west, and a dull or showery day, one
may fairly expect success; but to go out on a bright
clear day, with wind from the North or East, is, in
my opinion, neither pleasant nor profitable. I have
done it many times when I had less experience,
though not more enthusiasm, than at present, but I
seldom do it now. An old song says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A Southerly wind and a cloudy sky<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Proclaim a hunting morning;"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
</div></div>

<p>and they also tell the fly-fisher when to be off to the
river. I should not be doing justice to this part of
my subject if I were not to allude to the fly-fisher's
carnival, the May-fly season. From about the last week
in May till the middle of June is the time above all
others to catch trout. I have frequently caught five
or six brace in a couple of hours during this short
season; but as soon as it is over I put away the rod
for a few days, for, the fish being fairly glutted with
the natural fly, do not care much for the artificial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
after the former is gone, although it will sometimes
happen that on a rough, dull day, you can have good
sport for a week or ten days afterwards.</p>

<p>The length of the May-fly season depends greatly
on the weather. It generally lasts about three
weeks; but the present season (1888) has been
exceptionally wet and cold, and the flies were only
hatched at long and irregular intervals, owing to the
absence of sun. Consequently the season extended
from the second or third day of June till the second
week of July. On the 11th of June last I was fishing
with a May-fly and a small Soldier-palmer for drop,
my usual custom, and was struck by the difference
of the manner in which fish rose at the two flies.
The rise at the May-fly was bold and decisive, but
without undue haste, whilst that at the Palmer was a
sudden swish, without giving time to strike. I can
only account for this by the circumstance that
the natural May-fly is longer on the water than the
Palmer before it gets water-logged and sinks, and the
fish therefore know that they can take their time
about it. The stream was very difficult to fish, and I
lost a great many fish as well as flies from getting
entangled in the bushes; nevertheless I succeeded in
landing twelve brace of trout, besides some returned.</p>

<p>Next, as to the time of day. The most preferable
times are from about 8 a.m. till noon, and after
4 p.m. till midnight. In many trout clubs there is a
rule prohibiting fishing after half-past nine; but, if
you are not restricted in that respect, you will find
that the largest fish are taken from sunset till ten or
eleven o'clock. The only justification for late fishing
is that the very large trout, which often attain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
great size from preying on their own species, then
come out of their hiding-places and chase the small
fry up and down the shallows. These cannibalistic
old gentlemen, who do more harm than good in a
trout stream, do not usually rise at a fly, and can
only be caught with a live bait or worm, or by night
fishing with a sunk fly, and the end justifies the
means. White or brown moths are the favourites.
I had some moths made specially large, on strong
gut, for late fishing, but found it advisable to use a
short line and only one fly, and to get the fish into
the landing-net as soon as possible, for it is awkward
work to land a big fish after dark, particularly if
you are hampered with weeds or bushes.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>HABITS OF TROUT.</h3>


<p>A knowledge of the habits of trout is very essential,
and this knowledge can only be acquired by careful
observation. The largest fish are generally to be
found where they can obtain the best supply of food&mdash;such
points as just below sharp bends of the stream,
behind large stones or other obstructions, at the
head or tail of deep pools, and on the margin of
swift currents, or under overhanging banks; and, if
you take a good fish at any particular spot, you will
probably find, a day or two afterwards, that the next
best fish in that locality has taken the place of the
one you captured. It has often occurred to me that
there are several reasons why brook trout do not
thrive in the lower part of rivers communicating
with the sea. One thing is, to my mind, very certain&mdash;they
do not feel at home in salt, or even
brackish, water, and do not seek it of their own
accord. Having lived many years within sight of a
point where a fresh water stream flows into salt
water, I have had perhaps exceptional opportunities
of observing them, and forming an opinion on the subject;
and, although I have lately seen an apparently
well-supported contrary opinion strongly expressed,
I am not yet convinced, thinking that probably
some error may have crept in as to the kind of fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
or some disturbing cause taken place in the state of
the water. Occasionally they get washed down by
floods, or by the breaking away or uplifting of
hatches or gates; but, as soon as the rush of water
subsides, they begin to work their way up again, and
if there is an obstacle to their ascending, such as a
weir or mill, they are sure to be found close up to it,
having got as far as they can. They always seem
prompted by instinct to work upwards into shallow
rapid water, where the bottom is gravelly, and, I
believe, for the following reasons: They can there
deposit and cover up their ova, and, when hatched,
the young fry can get protection among it from their
numerous enemies in their early days; and, although
food may be plentiful in muddy sluggish streams
near salt water, it is not of the kind that trout
delight in. Larva, flies, and minnows abound in
clear bright streams, and there the trout can clean
themselves from their parasites, and, with healthy
bodies and abundance of the food they enjoy, come
into condition early, and become lusty and strong.</p>

<p>In the breeding time they, like many other
animals, lose their usual caution and shyness, and
when performing their natural functions seem to
take no notice of what is passing around them; and
thus very many of the best fish are captured in
shallow water, and the streams almost depopulated.
The greatest vigilance should be exercised in the
spawning time to prevent poachers, both human
and others, from preying upon them. In addition to
men, swans, ducks, otters, herons, pike, perch, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., all prey on the luckless trout and its ova and
fry, and the wonder is that the stock is so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
maintained as it is. Otters and herons in particular
appreciate this dainty, and either of them will travel
across country many miles to get to a well-stocked
trout stream. So strong is the instinct of the trout
to get into shallow streams to deposit their spawn,
that they will leap waterfalls several feet in height,
or wriggle up over gravel where there is not half
enough water to cover them, and where it is frequently
impossible for them to get back again, and
there they are often destroyed.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>WHERE TO GO FISHING.</h3>


<p>Having spoken of the <em>how</em> and <em>when</em>, next comes the
<em>where</em>; and under this head I feel bound, in the
interests of friends, not to describe, other than in
very general terms, the localities where good fishing
is to be had. Walton, from frequently visiting
Winchester, where his remains lie, and where a
statue of him has lately been erected by anglers,
(the movement for which I had the honour of starting),
was doubtless well acquainted with Hampshire&mdash;or,
as he quaintly calls it, "Hantshire,"&mdash;which, he
says, "exceeds all England for its swift, shallow,
clear, pleasant brooks, and store of trouts." In his
will he mentions part of his books as being at
Droxford (about eleven miles from Winchester),
where it is presumed he resided occasionally. I
know no better trout stream than that in this
locality. Many a basket of goodly trout have I had
from it in days gone by. It was near here that I
caught the two large trout at one time, before
alluded to.</p>

<p>I suppose at the present time the Avon, the Test,
and the Itchen are unsurpassed in the United
Kingdom. All the north, or what is commonly
called the <em>upper</em>, part of Hampshire, forms part of the
south-western edge of the basin of the Thames, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
is drained into it by the Wey, the Enborn, and the
Blackwater. The district east of Alton and north of
the South Downs is drained by the Rother, which is
a tributary of the river Arun, and discharges into
the English Channel, near Arundel, in Sussex. In
all these rivers, springing out of the chalk hills, there
is good trout fishing, but not equal to that on the
south side of the South Downs, where the country,
sloping away to the southward and westward, either
drains into the Solent or the river Avon; and it is to
these southern rivers and streams that Walton more
particularly alluded. The Test, or Anton, rises in
the neighbourhood of Andover and Whitchurch, and
falls into the Southampton Water to the westward
of the town of Southampton, while the Itchen,
rising near Alresford, and passing Winchester and
Bishopstoke, discharges into Southampton Water
to the eastward of the town. The Avon, entering
Hampshire from Wiltshire, and passing Fordingbridge
and Ringwood, discharges into Christchurch
Bay, where the Stour also empties itself. There are
also several smaller streams rising south of the hills
which stretch from Winchester to Petersfield, and
discharge themselves into the Solent. All these
streams are well stocked with trout, and some of
them contain roach, perch, pike, and grayling, and
the larger ones also salmon. If greater facilities
were given to salmon to ascend they would doubtless
do so, as they are occasionally caught in
stake nets while working their way along the south
coast, evidently in search of rivers, up which to
ascend for the purpose of spawning. But the river
proprietors do not provide means for the salmon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
go upwards, it being generally considered that salmon
and trout do not thrive well together, and that if
the breeding of salmon was encouraged it would be
at the expense of the trout fisheries.</p>

<p>Nearly all these Hampshire rivers are strictly preserved,
and some of those in the vicinity of Andover,
Stockbridge, Houghton, and Winchester are in the
hands of first-class clubs, the subscriptions to which
are high, and access difficult. Still, there are a few
pieces of free water at Winchester, Bishopstoke, and
Romsey; and Mr. Currell and Mr. Chalkley, both of
Winchester, rent considerable portions of the river
there, and issue season and day tickets. At Bishopstoke,
where there is some splendid trout and grayling
fishing, season and day tickets are now being issued
by the proprietor of a large estate, who has hitherto
preserved very highly, and would scarcely allow his
own friends to fish; and several instances have come
to my knowledge lately where landed proprietors,
only able to obtain a reduced income from their farms,
have been glad to supplement it by making a few
pounds annually out of their fishing. So that, to the
angler as well as the land owner, agricultural distress
is not an unmitigated evil. And if more attention
was paid to the stocking and preserving of rivers, the
incomes of landed proprietors might be considerably
increased, and a very important addition made to the
food of the country. The Avon, at Ringwood, in the
New Forest, about 100 miles S.W. of London, has
some good salmon, trout and grayling fishing, and
also very fine roach and perch. Day tickets can be
obtained of the hotel keepers. The Beaulieu river,
the tidal portion of which is, of course, free, is noted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
not only for its coarse fish, but also for quantities of
sea-trout that frequent it in the autumn months.</p>

<p>Fishermen have increased so rapidly in the last
few years that those who have fishing rights take
care of them, and where one could formerly go unchallenged,
he now has to ask permission for a day,
and very often may consider himself lucky if he gets
it. There are now about 180 angling societies in and
around London, consisting of nearly 5,000 members,
besides a large number of anglers who do not belong
to any society; consequently fish have been becoming
more and more scarce year after year, and the
increase of population and pollution of rivers have
also tended to drive them away. But, in order to
supply to some extent the deficiency, artificial breeding
has become very general. The National Piscicultural
Society breed and distribute immense numbers
of young trout every year. Greater efforts are also
being made than formerly to prevent poaching, the
destruction of undersized fish, and taking them when
out of season; therefore, the prospects of anglers
are beginning to look brighter.</p>

<p>In describing the <em>where</em> to go fishing, I have
alluded more particularly to Hampshire, not only
because it is the best part of England for trout, but
because it also happens to be the county with which
I am best acquainted.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the county, fishing for
trout with anything but an artificial fly is considered
unsportsmanlike, and is strictly prohibited in all
the clubs.</p>

<p>Still, there are many other localities where, if the
angler does not mind going farther afield, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
trout fishing can be obtained. For instance, Scotland
and Wales, where, from the hilly conformation
of the country, the streams are rapid and therefore
suitable for trout; Devonshire, where the trout are
small, but very numerous; the neighbourhood of
the Peak, in Derbyshire, than which there is none
much better; the upper portions of the Thames and
Lea and their tributaries&mdash;all these are worth the
fly-fisher's attention, and many of them will repay
him for the time and trouble spent in visiting them.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>CURIOUS CAPTURES.</h3>


<p>When fishing in Hampshire some ten or twelve
years ago, a moorhen came out of some bushes near
me and rushed down the brook, with its feet just
trailing along on the surface. As it was going over
my line I gave a twitch and hooked it in the under
part of the foot, where the skin is as tough as leather.
Then I had a lively time for about twenty minutes,
up and down, in and out; but my tackle was good,
and I handled the rod carefully, till at length the
bird was pretty well tired, and got in among some
bushes, and a friend who was with me went into
the water and got it into the landing-net. I
preserved it and had it mounted.</p>

<p>On another occasion I saw a rat swimming across
the stream, and pitched my fly just beyond him
and hooked him firmly. Of course he dived,
but could not get away from me, and at last came
ashore into the long grass where I was standing.
It was nearly dark and I could not see him, but
presently found he had got the line entangled round
my legs. I threw the rod down, and stamped about,
thinking to tread on him, but suppose I trod on the
gut, for he got away with it. When I picked up my
rod I found I had stamped on it also and broken it;
therefore I determined to let the next rat alone.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Another time I had been fishing late, with a white
moth, and, on leaving off, twisted the gut and fly round
my hat. Getting through a hedge the gut caught in
a bramble, and the fly went into my scalp, and the
more I pulled the worse it was. The same friend
was with me, and helped me out of it. We then
went to a doctor, who snipped away the hair and cut
the hook out.</p>

<p>It is not very often that an eel is taken with a fly,
but I was once fishing with a Palmer, and, being tired,
very carelessly laid my rod down with the fly in the
water, which, of course, sank to the bottom. I
strolled about, and coming back picked up the rod,
and found an eel attached, which I landed.</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p>Finally, fly-fishing may be considered one of the
best of sports, because it can be followed late in life.
Most devotees of sport, when the nerves become
shaky and the eyes grow dim, must content themselves
with thinking or talking of what they did in
their youth. But it is not so with the fly-fisher.
He can still throw a fly and play a trout, better
perhaps than in his youth, because of his greater
experience; and, when in the down-hill of life he looks
back on the hopes and anticipations of his boyhood
days, it must be gratifying to feel that the times
spent among the beauties of nature in exercising the
angler's art have been the most enjoyable parts of
his life, and that he is none the worse man for having
obeyed the precepts and followed the example of
our grand old past master, Izaak Walton.
</p>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>




<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<div class="appendix">
<p>It is doubtful whether the gratification of taking fish is equal
to that which results from the recital of the achievement, and
describing to a sympathetic audience the method and tackle by
which the prey has been ensnared. Walton and his friends,
after a long day, loved to meet at some village alehouse, and
fight their battles o'er again; and in the present day one of the
most enjoyable parts of the evening spent at an Angling Society
is when the chairman asks, "Has any one been fishing?" and
the members recount their piscatorial experiences since the last
meeting. Any one unaccustomed to such meetings would be
surprised at the knowledge of rivers, the country, the habits,
and the haunts of particular kinds of fish and insects, the various
sorts of baits and tackle to be used, and all the technical information
which the London angler displays on such occasions;
and this broader view of nature and life is not the least of the
benefits derived from following the piscatorial art.</p>

<p>The London clubs number about 200, with upwards of 5,000
members; and considering that a very large number of anglers
do not belong to any club, it will be readily understood that the
angling fraternity form a considerable part of the community,
whose great aim is to enjoy themselves in a rational and innocent
manner, away from the clank of machinery, the roar of street
traffic, and the stifling atmosphere of a great city; and every
assistance and encouragement should be given them to do so&mdash;and
they are progressing. Many of them practice fly-fishing;
and if trout are not to be got, there are chub, dace, and bleak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and occasionally a roach, to reward them for their skill. The one
great difficulty is where to get good fishing, and this is to some
extent overcome by the co-operation of anglers, through their
clubs and associations, who not only rent waters for their members,
but make arrangements with the railway companies to take
them into the country and back at greatly reduced fares. The
preserving and re-stocking of waters also form an important part
of the business of angling clubs. Experience has taught them that
it is of very little use to turn in fry before they are old enough
to take care of themselves, but that it is more satisfactory, and
ultimately more economical to purchase yearling fish in the first
place. These various matters have been so well attended to,
that, notwithstanding the great increase in the number of anglers,
access to well-stocked rivers is more easy of attainment now than
it was a few years ago.</p>

<p>Of course, every care should be taken to prevent poaching, to
keep down predaceous fish, and prevent undersized and out-of-season
fish from being taken; but with these precautions, if the
river is naturally adapted for the kind of fish required, there
should be no difficulty.</p>

<p>In the case of trout, the quantity, quality, and size will very
much depend on the quantity and kind of food to be obtained.
There should be plenty of weeds, sedge, flags, &amp;c., not only for
shelter, but they are the natural breeding places of insects and
crustacea, in which trout delight, and if the river is overhung
with trees and bushes it not only adds to the security of the fish,
but harbours flies and other insects which drop off into the
water.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center">WET <em>v.</em> DRY.</p>

<p>The difference between wet and dry fly-fishing is this: the
wet fly is worked gently along some few inches beneath the
surface until a fish is found, which, when they are scarce, or not
rising, may be a tedious process, and often the first intimation is
a sudden tug without any rise, which should be immediately
answered by as sudden a twitch from the wrist.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The dry-fly fisherman walks quietly along by the side of the
stream, and if he sees a trout rising, drops his fly lightly a little
above it, and preferably also a little on one side, and lets it float
down stream on the surface to the fish, gently raising the point
of his rod in the meantime. In case no fish are rising, he carefully
casts to the most likely-looking spots, and particularly under
the bank on which he is standing.</p>

<p>In nine cases out of ten, a trout, if it rises at all, takes the dry
fly immediately it touches the water; therefore, one should learn
to cast clean and straight, without any slack line.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center">TACKLE.</p>

<p>There is a great difference of opinion among anglers as to the
amount of pliancy a fly-rod ought to possess. From the old-fashioned,
heavy, stiff rod, we have gone to the other extreme,
and had cane rods so light and whippy as to be entirely useless
on a windy day; and now we have what is, in my opinion, a somewhat
sensible reaction, and are coming back to a greenheart from
ten to twelve feet long, of medium substance and pliability.</p>

<p>Such a rod, with an Acme line suited to it, and the whole
adapted to the height and strength of the angler, ought to make
good casting. Long casting may be showy, but in practice it is
far better to cast lightly and accurately, and this tends to fill the
basket much more than being able to get out an extra length.
One piece of advice may be relied on: never part with a good
rod after you have become accustomed to it. It is not only the
pleasurable associations connected with it, but the confidence you
have in it, and, through it, in yourself, enables you to kill fish
with it.</p>

<p>With care, it may be made to last a lifetime. I used, the other
day, at the International Tournament, a greenheart that I have
used almost exclusively for about twelve years, and with which I
have killed many hundred brace of trout. If, on the occasion
referred to, I had used an Ogden and Scotford's <em>multum in parvo</em>,
I believe I should have thrown two yards farther.<br /><br /></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">FLIES.</p>

<p>I see no reason to alter the list given in the first edition, indeed,
subsequent experience has tended to confirm my opinion expressed
therein.</p>

<p>Many old anglers say it is of no use in the May-fly season to try
any other fly. I generally use a May-fly as stretcher, and a small
Soldier-palmer as drop, and out of seventeen-and-a-half brace of
trout caught last Whitsuntide in two half-days, one-third of them
were caught on the Palmer. Others say it is useless to try a
May-fly, except when the natural fly is out; but this is also
subject to modification.</p>

<p>There have been two or three well-authenticated cases reported
in the sporting journals lately, of fish having been killed some
weeks before and after the season on <em>Ephemera vulgata</em>. Indeed,
there has been seen in Ireland this autumn a <em>second</em> very
strong rise of May-fly.</p>

<p>In the first edition I speak of the Grey-drake thus:&mdash;"This is
said to be a metamorphosis of the green drake, or female, changing
to a male." The passage should have read thus:&mdash;"This is <em>said
by some writers</em> to be," &amp;c.</p>

<p>I had not the slightest intention of giving that as a fact, or as
my own opinion, knowing otherwise.</p>

<p>Flies tied on eyed hooks with cocked or upright wings, in
imitation of the natural fly when floating down a stream, are
coming into use more and more, and apparently will supersede
those tied on gut, and with flat wings.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center">WHEN TO GO FISHING.</p>

<p>A century ago it was not possible to get forecasts of the weather
from the daily papers, and the death of Admiral Fitzroy in middle
life, and in the midst of his scientific discoveries, was a great blow
to the advancement of this branch of science. But with greater
facilities for conveying intelligence round the whole globe, it could
not but happen that more accurate information of air currents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
should be sent forward to the countries likely to be affected by
them.</p>

<p>The following is from the "Art of Angling," published in
1810:&mdash;"It is the best fishing in a river somewhat disturbed by
rain, or on a cloudy day when the waters are moved with a gentle
breeze; the south and west winds are the best, and if the wind
blows high, yet not so but that you may conveniently guide your
tackle, then fishes will rise in the still deeps; but if there is little
wind stirring, the best angling is in swift streams.</p>

<p>"In casting your line, do it always before you, and in such a
manner that the fly may fall first on the water. When you throw
your line, wave the rod in a small circumference round your head,
and never make a return of it before the line has had its full scope,
or the fly will snap off.</p>

<p>"Although when you angle the day is cloudy and windy, and
the water thick, you must keep the fly in continual motion,
otherwise the fishes will discern the deceit.</p>

<div class="poem small"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'... Upon the curling surface let it glide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nat'ral motion from your hand suppli'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the stream now let it gently play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in the rapid eddy float away.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"When fishes rise at the fly very often, and yet never take
it, you may conclude that it is not what they like, therefore
change it for the one they do."<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center">PLAYING A FISH.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"... Should you lure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his dark haunt, beneath the tangled roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pendent trees, the monarch of the brook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behoves you then to ply your finest art;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time he, following cautious, scans the fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft attempts to seize it, but as oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dimpled water speaks his jealous fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, while haply o'er the shaded sun<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Passes a cloud, he desperate takes the death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sullen plunge: at once he darts along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep struck, and runs out all the lengthen'd line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seeks the farthest ooze, the sheltering weed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cavern'd bank, his own secure abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flies aloft, and flounces round the pool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indignant of the guile. With yielding hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That feels him still, yet to his furious course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives way, you, now retiring, following now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the stream, exhaust his idle rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till floating broad upon his breathless side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his fate abandon'd, to the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You gaily drag your unresisting prize."<br /></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>


<p class="center">CASTING.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of casts to be used, for the <em>ordinary</em>
casts will be of little avail under some circumstances. To
make the ordinary cast, begin with a short line, and by the action
of the wrist and forearm propel it out in front of you, so that
when it is extended to the full length, the fly will be two or three
feet above the surface, on which it should fall by its own weight.
In repeating the cast raise the point of the rod slowly, and
bring it back over your right shoulder, so that the line shall
describe the shape of a horse-shoe behind you; then throw it
forward again in the same manner as before; keep casting in
this way until you can throw a tolerable length, say, twelve
or fourteen yards, always striving more for accuracy and delicacy
than length.</p>

<p>Sometimes a fish may be seen rising which is out of reach
of the ordinary cast. In such case it will be necessary to
adopt what is called the <em>augmented</em> cast.</p>

<p>Throw out as much line as you can in the ordinary way,
then with the forefinger of the right-hand press the line
against the rod, draw two or three yards off the reel with the
left hand; bring back the line and throw it forward again,
and just before it reaches its fullest extent remove your finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and the impetus of the line will carry out the two or three
yards taken off the reel.</p>

<p>The <em>spey</em> throw is used for a similar purpose. If you
are fishing a large river or lake with a strong wind behind
you, when the line is extended to its utmost limit by the
ordinary cast, whisk the fly off the water by an upward and
backward movement of the hand; but deliver it forward again,
just as the last of the reel line is leaving the surface, by a
rapid downward cut with the upper portion of the rod. It is
possible in this way to get out four or five yards more line
than by the ordinary cast.</p>

<p>When trees or bushes overhang the water the <em>side</em> cast is
sometimes useful. Let out a short line, and wave the rod
from side to side horizontally, until the line follows the motion
of the rod, then pull a yard or two off the reel and swish it
on to the water. The best way to get it off again is to reel
in.</p>

<p>It will occasionally happen that when trees are overhanging
there is not room on either side to use the side cast. The
<em>underhand</em> cast here comes in.</p>

<p>Take the fly between the finger and thumb of the left hand,
and by giving the rod a forward and upward motion, drop
the fly on to the water in front of you.</p>

<p>When high bushes stand between you and the river the
<em>steeple</em> cast is handy. By the action of the rod work the line
up perpendicularly above your head, then pitch it down over
the bushes on to the water.</p>

<p>These special casts are only used in special circumstances
requiring them, but they are often instrumental in producing
big fish from otherwise inaccessible spots, and it is in such
spots that the big fish generally lie.<br /><br /></p>


<p class="center">ANGLING CLUBS.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would recommend all anglers, whether living
in London or the provinces, to join a good club: they there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
meet kindred spirits, and form friendships and connections,
that make life pleasant.</p>

<p>Many of these clubs rent waters for the use of their members,
which would not be within the reach of individuals.</p>

<p>Scientific papers on the art are occasionally read, and discussions
based on them; lectures and smoking concerts are
often added to the programme; some of them possess extensive
circulating libraries accessible to their members only, while
most of their rooms are hung with specimen fish, portraits of
prominent anglers, aquatic birds, flies, &amp;c. In winter evenings,
when angling is out of the question, the interest in the sport
is thus kept up, and plans for the coming season formed, tackle
compared, and various other matters arranged.</p>

<p>Most of the London clubs admit country members at a
lower rate of subscription than ordinary members, and thus
benefits accrue on both sides. Country members, when in
town, can obtain all the advantages enumerated, and they have
occasionally the opportunity of procuring the town member
a day's fishing "far from the madding crowd."</p>

<p>Dear Sir,&mdash;I promised to let you know how those small
eyed snecks did among heavy fish. I am glad to find them
exceeding good; so far I have had no accidents with them,
and I had some very heavy fish. Amongst others, I have
killed during the last four days six grayling weighing 15lb.,
the heaviest brace going a trifle over 5<span class="num">3</span>&#8260;<span class="denom">4</span>lb. All these fish
have been killed on your cobweb gut, which is the best I
ever had&mdash;a perfect marvel of strength and fineness combined.
Most of my fish have succumbed to the tiny Orange
Tags I had from you a fortnight ago, though the largest fish,
a three-pounder, came home on a light Olive. The Orange
Tag is, however, about the best grayling fly it is possible to
use on a sunny day, and it will, in bright weather, frequently
do execution with trout. I hooked three good fish with it
in less than ten minutes one day last week.</p>
